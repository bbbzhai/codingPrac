# Plans to keep track of progress

Week 1 (May 13 - May 20)
1. Go over some basic C++ books
	* C++ Primer
	* Accelerated C++ 
2. 5 Leetcode Problems daily

* May 13
	* Didn't do much, wasted a day.
	* Finally watched Avenger End Game.
* May 14
	* Progress slower than I expected.
	* Went over some C++ basic concept, the reason I went over it is I don't want to miss anything, just in case.
		* definition vs. declaration
		* reference and pointer
		* const keyword
* May 15
	* Went over Cpp concepts
	* Should've done some leetcode problems, but too lazy.
* May 16
	* I originally thought cpp primer was a beginner's book. Well, it is a very comprehensive and not so beginner's book. So I decide to buy a real book and read a chapter very day, instead of what I originally plan to do, which is to go over the concepts as soon as possible. 
	* Just ordered the book from Amazon. Will get it next week. I will keep reading 1 chapter/day.
